# YoutubeApp v1.0.42-alpha
My fork of Unofficial Youtube Client (UWP app for Desktop)

## About
The Unofficial Youtube Client is a youtube application built in UWP using the Google Dotnet API libraries with a goal of improving upon the ad infested and under-featured apps found on the windows store. The project strives to provide a coherent and simplistic UI while providing responsive and battery considerate performance across the board. Due to the limitations of the Google API, work arounds are being found for home page recommendations and viewing history.

## My 2 cents / Status 
- RnD (42 % complete)
- Min. os win sdk : 14393
- VLC & VideoLib synthez 
- GoogleAuth-on-W10M fixed
- Experimental "VLCLibSharp uwp edition" library (for VS 2017 compatibility and best on-device debugging)
- Hardware button back-to-main-page fixed
- Flyout menu auto-hiding added 
- Draft / Proto (UI damaged very hard - no video comments, no mediacontrols, etc.!)
